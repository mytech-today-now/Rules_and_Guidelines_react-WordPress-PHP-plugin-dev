# Augment AI Rules & User Guidelines â€“ VS Code Development for WordPress Plugins

This document defines standards, workflows, and guidelines for WordPress plugin development using React for admin UI, PHP for backend, and mySQL for database. It enforces consistency, maintainability, security, and professionalism in Augment AI projects. Guidelines fit VS Code workflows.

---

## Core Development Rules

### 1. Architecture and Code Organization

RULE: Follow Layered Architecture with Separation of Concerns

Structure plugins for modularity and reusability. Each layer has defined responsibilities. Follow SOLID principles for WordPress hooks, actions, filters, and React components. Specific: Limit layers to 3-5 per plugin. General: Review layers quarterly; document layer map.

#### Key Principles
- Modularity: Use independent modules for development. Separate PHP services from React components and mySQL access; prefix modules with plugin name; limit module size to 500 lines; use subfolders for large modules.
- Dependency Management: Use WP patterns or Composer for PHP. Enqueue React scripts with wp_enqueue_script; declare dependencies in enqueue; version scripts; load conditional on user role.
- Avoid: Coupling to WP globals without abstraction, god classes, circular dependencies; no direct $post access; no hardcode paths; no static calls across layers.
- Benefits: Improves readability, debugging, WP multisite support; enables theme compatibility; supports updates; reduces load time.
- Add: Use namespaces for PHP classes to avoid conflicts; register React scripts in admin only when needed; conditional enqueue on page; dequeue on uninstall; lazy load services.

- Data/Logic Layer: Handle business logic, validation, mySQL via $wpdb. Use DDD entities and repositories; index mySQL tables for queries; use custom tables prefixed; backup tables on activate; migrate on update.
- Presentation Layer: Use React for admin, PHP templates for public. Use hooks or Redux for state; enqueue styles separately from scripts; use CSS modules in React; minify CSS; optimize images.
- Control Layer: Use WP hooks, AJAX handlers. Add nonces, validate requests, log points; use add_action for entry, do_action for exit; priority on hooks; remove on deactivate; schedule cron if needed.
- Services: PHP classes for external calls. Keep stateless, use transients, version for WP; cache API responses in options; timeout on calls; retry logic; validate responses.
- Utilities: Pure functions for tasks like sanitization; test utilities without WP load; export for reuse; inline if small; memoize if pure.
- Types/Interfaces: PHP interfaces for hooks, TS for React. Use contracts, generics, runtime validation; type hint all PHP params; PropTypes in React; default props; validate interfaces.

ENFORCE: Keep layer boundaries. Delegate queries to services. Use PHPCS for checks; custom sniffs for layers; fail build on violate. Specific: Audit boundaries per PR; log violations. General: Train team on SOLID; layer diagram in repo.

VS Code: Use Outline (Ctrl+Shift+O) for navigation. Error Lens for warnings. Dependency Cruiser for rules; set up snippets for WP hooks; graph view for deps; hover docs; color layers.

---

### 2. File Naming and Structure

RULE: Consistent Naming Patterns

Use names that show intent. Specific: Review names in code review. General: Document conventions in README; lint names; update yearly.

- Services: camelCaseService.php in /includes/services/; prefix with plugin slug; abstract suffix if needed; singleton if global; doc purpose.
- Components/UI: PascalCase.jsx in /admin/js/components/; snake_case.php in /admin/partials/; group by feature folder; index file for exports; story for components; test file adjacent.
- Utilities: camelCase.php/js in /includes/utils/; one function per file if complex; barrel exports JS; type file alongside; version if public.
- Models/Types: PascalCase.php/ts in /includes/models/; separate interfaces from classes; DTO pattern; validate models; schema file.
- Tests: .test.php/jsx mirroring source in /tests/; add coverage per file; setup file shared.

ENFORCE: No generic names. Follow WP structure: /includes/, /admin/, /public/, /assets/, /languages/; /templates/ for views; /build/ for minified; /migrations/ for DB. Specific: Structure check in CI. General: Folder permissions; archive old.

VS Code: Compact Folders. Ctrl+P search. Prettier/ESLint/PHPCS on save; use search for hook names; exclude node_modules; glob patterns; file icons.

---

### 3. Language and Framework Standards

RULE: Strict Configurations

Use strict typing and validation. Specific: Enforce in CI. General: Audit compliance monthly; train on standards.

- Type-check: declare(strict_types=1) in PHP, strict TS, prepared $wpdb; check WP capabilities in functions; use ? for nullable; enum for statuses; strict mode JS.
- Declare returns: In PHP/TS; use union types for WP errors; void for no return; mixed only last resort; annotate all.
- No untyped: Avoid mixed, raw queries; escape all outputs; no var_dump; no die; no eval.
- Error handling: Try-catch with WP_Error; log with error_log; custom exceptions; throw early; rethrow if needed.
- Validate: WP sanitize, Zod for props; check nonces in AJAX; rate limit inputs; CSRF tokens; schema validate.

#### PHP/WP Style Rules

Variables: camelCase, const preferred, no globals except WP; prefix locals if needed; $this_ for class; underscore private; init in constructor.

Functions: Closures for hooks, destructure params, 20-30 lines, private props, pure, immutable args; return early on fails; single responsibility; named args PHP8; doc params.

Strings: Double for interp, single literals, esc_html output; use __() for translatable; plural gettext; sprintf format; concat with .

Conditionals: ===, early returns, capability checks; if WP_DEBUG add checks; switch for roles; ternary simple; match PHP8.

Async: WP AJAX hooks, try-catch, wp_send_json_error, AbortController in JS; limit concurrent requests; poll for long tasks; web worker if heavy; promise chain.

Modules: Composer autoload, group imports, spread over .apply; require once for files; conditional load; lazy load; dynamic require if rare.

Safety: wp_verify_nonce, esc_attr, ?? for defaults; filter inputs with apply_filters; validate emails; URL check; IP validate.

Arrays: map/filter/reduce, foreach, array_pad; use array_key_exists for checks; sort consistent; unique keys; diff/merge.

PHP: Interfaces for hooks, annotate params/returns; use traits for shared logic; abstract classes; final methods; namespace use.

Debugging: error_log JSON, no echo, WP_DEBUG; conditional debug if !WP_DEBUG; log levels; stack trace; profiler if slow.

Data: readonly props, WP_Query over arrays; use get_transient for cache; serialize options; unserialize safe; validate unserialize.

Input: sanitize_*, type guards; validate file uploads size/type; MIME check; virus scan if possible; hash files.

Documentation: PHPDoc/JSDoc, wp_date; @since for versions; @param types; @return desc; @example code.

Frameworks: WP standards, React hooks, mySQL index; update PHPCS/ESLint monthly; React memo; SQL explain; optimize table.

#### React/mySQL
- React: Hooks for state, WP REST fetch, sanitize props; use useCallback for handlers; error boundaries; suspense load; context providers.
- mySQL: $wpdb->prepare, esc_sql; use transactions for multi-queries; error on fail; last error log; vacuum tables.

VS Code: PHP Intelephense, TS ext, Problems panel, formatOnSave, ESLint/PHPCS; keybind for WP doc lookup; theme WP colors; folding regions; snippet pack.

- Extensions: ESLint/Prettier/GitLens/Thunder/Jest/Error Lens/Version Lens/GitHub PRs/Markdown/PHP Intelephense/WP-CLI; WP Snippets; Docker; Remote SSH; Bracket Pair.
- Settings: .vscode/json formatOnSave true, quote single, autoSave delay, codeActions fixAll eslint/phpcs; WP debug true; indent 2; tab size 2; bracket color.
- Tasks: tasks.json test/npm, wp-lint/shell; WP activate task; build zip; deploy task; clean cache.
- Launch: launch.json Node React, Xdebug PHP; mySQL breakpoint; WP debug port; React hot reload; multi config.
- Keybindings: json Ctrl+Shift+T test, Ctrl+G Git, Ctrl+Alt+W WP-CLI; save all; format doc; comment toggle; find symbol.
- Workspace: extensions.json recommend. Remote-Containers WP; Docker compose; port forward; volume map; devcontainer.
- ENFORCE: Shared .vscode no secrets. Configure on open; sync settings; backup config; migrate guide; validate setup.

Specific: Update exts quarterly. General: Team config share; VS Code policy.

## AI Task Completion

RULE: Reinforcement for Tasklist

Adhere/complete tasklist for deliverables. Use checklist. Specific: Check per response. General: Weekly self-audit; share with user.

Principles:
- Holistic: Verify tasks pre-final. MD notes; mark done; share checklist; version checklist; archive complete.
- No Skip: Mandatory. Issue if delay; priority high; due date; escalate; notify user.
- Iterative: Audit post-step. Review query; log audit; metric track; improve; adjust plan.
- Prompts: "Review: Architecture complete, Testing 98%, etc." Commit notes; timestamp; sign off; peer review; user confirm.

Checklist:
- [ ] Architecture: Layers/hooks separated; no direct queries; SOLID check; namespace all; layer map.
- [ ] Naming: Patterns WP/PHP/React; prefix slug; consistent case; no abbr; lint names.
- [ ] Language: Strict/types/styles; nonces in async; escapes all; capability check; validate lib.
- [ ] Testing: 98%/18 organized; cache clear; flaky fixed; device test; trend up.
- [ ] Docs: VERSION/CHANGELOG/README/inline; examples run; links valid; translate ready; coverage 90.
- [ ] Versioning: Semantic WP; dep notices; lock commit; audit clean; policy doc.
- [ ] Security: Secrets/validate/errors; OWASP check; scan pass; role test; rotation plan.
- [ ] Performance: Resources/limits; transients use; index queries; bundle min; budget set.
- [ ] VC: Commits/issues/branches; templates; signed commits; protect main; prune old.
- [ ] Pre-commit: Linting/types/tests/scans; coverage gate; audit zero; secrets no; update hooks.
- [ ] Workflow: Branch/PR/review/merge; staging verify; prod prep; release tag; retrospective.
- [ ] Review: Checks performed; feedback addressed; approved 1+; changes test; metrics track.
- [ ] Env: Isolated validated; Docker local; config diff; backup env; rotate creds.
- [ ] Deps: Audited/pinned; weekly audit; update PR; compat test; source audit.
- [ ] Monitoring: Endpoints/logging; alert test; log sample; metric dash; tune alerts.
- [ ] Deploy: Checklist/rollback; blue-green; canary; post deploy test; incident plan.
- [ ] VS Code: Exts/settings/tasks; keybinds; workspace sync; theme set; policy share.
- [ ] Overall: Enhancements covered, errors fallbacks; WP multisite; user notice; perf baseline; user test.

ENFORCE: Integrate response. Guide users. Loop 100%; flag incompletes; progress bar; auto complete; share audit.

## Necessity of Tasks

RULE: Exhaustive Completion

Completion is requirement for quality/reliability/professionalism. Partial undermines consistency/maintainability/security, leads to failures/debt/trust loss. Specific: 100% per PR. General: Audit annual; train new.

Why Essential:
- Risk: Skips expose vulns/regressions/bottlenecks, breaches/downtime/losses. Completion identifies/resolves pre-prod; mySQL injections; nonce bypass; XSS risk; audit trail.
- Scalability: Fragments code, complicates enhancements. Full modular/self-doc, reduces onboarding; WP updates easy; theme compat; multisite scale; extend API.
- Compliance: Violates gates/reviews/audits. Full accountability/trace/versioning, prod-ready; WP.org approve; license check; GPL comply; legal review.
- User: Expects seamless/secure/perf. Neglect frustrates/gaps. Full vets 18 categories, robust software; admin ease; mobile support; i18n ready; feedback loop.
- Efficiency: Upfront min rework/debug/incidents. Tools automate, habit; CI time save; bug rate down; velocity up; ROI calc.

ENFORCE: Contract. Deviate Issue/plan. Quarterly metrics success. 100% or mediocrity; track adherence; reward full; penalty partial; celebrate milestones.

# Method for Augment AI VS Code WP

Rules for VS Code WP repo interact. Thoughtful solve, clarify assumptions, collaborate user, best practices. Adhere, quality/understanding > speed.

## Principles
- Clarity: Understand context pre-changes. State/verify assumptions; list numbered; WP specific; cite file; update on new info.
- Question: Ask targeted uncertainties, no guesses; 1-3 max; follow up; clarify term; prioritize Qs.
- Incremental: Small/testable, code move/refactor; one file first; commit per; revert easy; test each.
- Collaboration: Partner, pause decisions, no brute; confirm plan; alt propose; user lead; co-decide.
- Reflection: Identify blocker, propose Qs/alts; list options; prioritize; time box; doc lesson.

## Rules
1. Analysis:
   - Scan structure deps/modules patterns pre-suggest; note WP dirs; dep tree; size est; compat check.
   - Unclear? Ask: "Files React/PHP WP; clarify framework?" List key files; purpose query; goal align; constraint list.

2. Movement/Refactor:
   - Outline impact: "Move hook affects 3 files; verify?" List files; risk list; cost benefit; test plan.
   - No large no approval. Plan ask: "Align goals?" Steps numbered; time est; fallback; milestone.

3. Assumption:
   - List start response: "Assumptions: (1) /v1/users; (2) errorHandler." Bold key; source cite; confidence level; impact if wrong.
   - Q each: " (1) accurate, check config?" Suggest verify; default if no; update list; confirm all.

4. Questioning:
   - Ambiguity: Pause 1-3 Qs; specific WP; closed/open mix; why/how; user impact.
   - Examples: "Goal perf/read?" "5 files; compat?" "Resolve type; details hook?" Edge mySQL; user role; scale impact; alt cost.
   - Suggest post-answer; no code til clear; confirm answer; summarize; next Q if; chain Qs.

5. Workflow:
   - Assess: Describe confirm: "Asking [task]; correct?" WP restate; goal align; scope bound; success measure.
   - Plan: High-level risks: "Risk deps; mitigate?" Bullet risks; tools list; milestones; resource need.
   - Execute: One change, test terminal, feedback: "Diff; npm test results?" Run command; expected out; diff show; verify user.
   - Iterate: Explain fail pivot: "Failed [ ]; explore [ ]?" Why brief; lesson note; retry count; adjust plan.

6. Pitfalls:
   - Concise thorough; under 200 words; bullet if list; bold key; user focus.
   - Ask > assume; 1+ Q unless clear; unless trivial; log Qs; Q count; follow-through.
   - Override speed: Quality > Velocity; log override; balance time; user time; estimate effort.

## Enforcement/Log
- Log Qs/assumps "Augment AI Log" channel; timestamp, export option(s), and filter log(s); search by date/user.
- Violate flag: "Proceeded no fullâ€”review"; suggest fix, self correct, learn from, and report incident.

Follow rules, human-like WP dev VS Code; iterate method; feedback loop; continuous improve.
