## Application Architecture

RULE: Decoupled Server-Client Model with WordPress Plugin Server and PWA Client

The application server operates as a WordPress plugin installed on a standard WordPress host, handling backend logic, mySQL interactions, and exposing APIs via WP REST API extensions. The client is a Progressive Web App (PWA) built with React, which connects to the WordPress host over HTTPS for data fetching, updates, and authentication. This architecture promotes separation of concerns, enables offline functionality, and supports seamless installation on user devices. Specific: Ensure plugin exposes all necessary endpoints under /wp-json/augment/v1/; PWA must register service worker on load. General: Audit API compatibility quarterly; document connection flows in README; test PWA install prompts across browsers.

#### Key Principles
- Server as Plugin: Leverage WP core for authentication (JWT or WP sessions), scheduling (WP cron), and security (nonces). Prefix all custom tables, hooks, and endpoints with 'augment_'; migrate schemas on plugin activation; handle WP updates gracefully with version checks.
- Client as PWA: Use React for UI, Workbox for service workers, and IndexedDB for local storage. Manifest.json defines app metadata; support add-to-homescreen; offline-first design with sync queues. Connect via fetch to WP REST; use WP API client libraries like @wordpress/api-fetch.
- Connection Mechanism: Secure HTTPS only; OAuth2 or WP application passwords for auth; retry logic on network failures; heartbeat pings for session validity; compress payloads with GZIP.
- Avoid: Tight coupling like embedding WP scripts in PWA; direct mySQL access from client; unversioned APIs; ignoring PWA lighthouse scores.
- Benefits: Offline access reduces latency; PWA install boosts engagement; plugin modularity eases WP theme/plugin conflicts; scalable to multiple WP hosts.
- Add: Implement webhook endpoints in plugin for push updates to PWA; use Push API for notifications; cache API responses in service worker; sync data on reconnect with conflict resolution.

GUIDELINE: Offline-First Data Synchronization. Queue mutations in IndexedDB during offline; sync on reconnect via WP REST POST/PUT; resolve conflicts with last-write-wins or server-authoritative; log sync states; test with Chrome DevTools network throttling.

- Plugin Server Layer: Extend WP REST controllers for custom routes; validate requests with WP capabilities; sanitize inputs server-side; log API calls with user context; rate-limit endpoints per IP/user.
- PWA Client Layer: Register service worker for caching strategies (stale-while-revalidate for reads, network-first for writes); handle install/activate events; prompt for permissions (notifications, storage); lazy-load components for initial load speed.
- Integration Layer: Use WP nonces in API calls from PWA; refresh tokens automatically; fallback to cached data on 5xx errors; monitor connection with navigator.onLine and beacon API for unsent analytics.
- Security Layer: Enforce CORS headers in plugin (allow PWA origin only); validate origins in AJAX; encrypt sensitive local data; audit PWA for XSS via DOMPurify.
- Performance Layer: Pre-cache critical assets in service worker; optimize WP API responses with fields param; use React Query for client-side caching; aim for PWA score >90 on Lighthouse.

ENFORCE: Validate architecture in CI: Run WP-CLI to test plugin endpoints; simulate PWA offline with Puppeteer; fail build if sync fails >5%; document API schema in OpenAPI. Specific: PRs must include PWA connection tests. General: Train on PWA debugging; architecture diagram in repo with draw.io.

VS Code: Use Live Server extension for PWA preview; Lighthouse panel for audits; WP-CLI tasks for server sim; Network tab for connection traces; service worker debugger.

RULE: Progressive Enhancement for PWA Features. Ensure core functionality works without PWA traits (e.g., as SPA); add offline/install progressively; test graceful degradation; support legacy browsers via polyfills; measure adoption metrics.

## Core Development Rules

### 1. Architecture and Code Organization

RULE: Follow Layered Architecture with Separation of Concerns

Structure plugins modularly for reusability. Layers have defined roles. Apply SOLID to WP hooks, actions, filters, React components. Limit: 3-5 layers/plugin. Review layers quarterly; doc layer map.

#### Key Principles
- Modularity: Independent modules. Separate PHP services, React components, mySQL; prefix with plugin name; <=500 lines/module; subfolders for large.
- Dependency Management: WP patterns/Composer for PHP. Enqueue React via wp_enqueue_script; declare deps; version scripts; conditional load by role.
- Avoid: WP global coupling sans abstraction, god classes, circular deps; no direct $post; no hardcoded paths; no cross-layer statics.
- Benefits: Boosts readability, debugging, multisite; theme compat; updates; load time.
- Add: Namespace PHP classes; admin-only React scripts; conditional enqueue; dequeue on uninstall; lazy-load services.

GUIDELINE: Event-Driven for Loose Coupling. WP actions/filters as events; React custom events via EventEmitter; subscribe in control layer; avoid direct calls; log flows.

- Data/Logic Layer: Business logic, validation, mySQL via $wpdb. DDD entities/repos; index tables; prefixed custom tables; backup on activate; migrate on update.
- Presentation Layer: React admin, PHP public templates. Hooks/Redux state; separate style enqueues; React CSS modules; minify CSS; optimize images.
- Control Layer: WP hooks, AJAX. Nonces, validate reqs, log; add_action entry, do_action exit; hook priorities; remove on deactivate; cron if needed.
- Services: Stateless PHP for externals. Transients, WP-versioned; cache API in options; timeouts; retries; validate resp.
- Utilities: Pure funcs for sanitization etc.; test sans WP; export/reuse; inline small; memoize pure.
- Types/Interfaces: PHP interfaces for hooks, TS for React. Contracts, generics, runtime val; type-hint PHP params; React PropTypes; defaults; validate.

ENFORCE: Maintain boundaries; delegate queries to services. PHPCS checks, custom layer sniffs; build fail on violation. Audit/PR; log violations. Train SOLID; repo layer diagram.

VS Code: Outline (Ctrl+Shift+O) nav. Error Lens warnings. Dep Cruiser rules; WP hook snippets; dep graph; hover docs; layer colors. Madge for circ deps; tasks.json scans.

RULE: Micro-Frontends for React Scalability. Break admin into feature React apps; dynamic imports; share core utils only; version each; isolate tests.

---

### 2. File Naming and Structure

RULE: Consistent Naming Patterns

Intent-showing names. Review in CR. Doc in README; lint names; yearly update.

- Services: camelCaseService.php /includes/services/; slug prefix; abstract suffix if; singleton global; doc purpose.
- Components/UI: PascalCase.jsx /admin/js/components/; snake_case.php /admin/partials/; feature folders; index exports; stories; adjacent tests.
- Utilities: camelCase.php/js /includes/utils/; 1 func/file complex; JS barrel exports; types alongside; version public.
- Models/Types: PascalCase.php/ts /includes/models/; sep interfaces/classes; DTOs; validate; schema file.
- Tests: .test.php/jsx mirror src /tests/; per-file cov; shared setup.

GUIDELINE: Standardize Config/Log Files. plugin-slug-config.php /includes/config/; plugin-slug-logs.sql /logs/; timestamps in logs; .json API configs.

ENFORCE: No generics. WP struct: /includes/, /admin/, /public/, /assets/, /languages/; /templates/ views; /build/ minified; /migrations/ DB. CI struct check. Folder perms; archive old.

VS Code: Compact Folders. Ctrl+P search. Prettier/ESLint/PHPCS save; hook search; exclude node_modules; globs; icons. File Nesting for grouping.

RULE: Assets by Type/Version. /assets/ sub: /css/, /js/, /images/; version hashes in names; /src/ unminified.

---

### 3. Language and Framework Standards

RULE: Strict Configurations

Strict typing/validation. CI enforce. Monthly audit; standards train.

- Type-check: PHP declare(strict_types=1), strict TS, prepared $wpdb; WP cap checks; ? nullable; enums statuses; JS strict.
- Declare returns: PHP/TS; WP error unions; void no-ret; mixed last; annotate all.
- No untyped: Avoid mixed/raw queries; escape outputs; no var_dump/die/eval.
- Error handling: Try-catch WP_Error; error_log; custom exc; throw early; rethrow if.
- Validate: WP sanitize, Zod props; AJAX nonces; rate-limit inputs; CSRF; schema val.

GUIDELINE: Functional Paradigms. Pure utils funcs; array map/filter/reduce; no side-effects React hooks; compose complex; test composable.

#### PHP/WP Style Rules

Variables: camelCase, const pref, no globals but WP; local prefix if; $this_ class; _ private; ctor init.

Functions: Hook closures, destructure params, 20-30 lines, private props, pure, immutable args; early returns fails; SRP; PHP8 named args; doc params.

Strings: Double interp, single literals, esc_html out; __() trans; plural gettext; sprintf; . concat.

Conditionals: ===, early ret, cap checks; WP_DEBUG checks; role switch; simple ternary; PHP8 match.

Async: WP AJAX hooks, try-catch, wp_send_json_error, JS AbortController; limit concurrent; poll long; web workers heavy; promise chains.

Modules: Composer autoload, grouped imports, .apply spread; require_once; conditional/lazy load; rare dynamic.

Safety: wp_verify_nonce, esc_attr, ?? defaults; apply_filters inputs; email/URL/IP val.

Arrays: map/filter/reduce, foreach, array_pad; array_key_exists checks; consistent sort; unique keys; diff/merge.

PHP: Hook interfaces, annotate params/returns; traits shared; abstract classes; final methods; namespace use.

Debugging: JSON error_log, no echo, WP_DEBUG; !WP_DEBUG conditional; levels; stack; slow profiler.

Data: readonly props, WP_Query > arrays; get_transient cache; safe serialize/unserialize; val unserialize.

Input: sanitize_*, type guards; upload size/type/MIME; virus scan; file hash.

Documentation: PHPDoc/JSDoc, wp_date; @since vers; @param types; @return desc; @example.

Frameworks: WP std, React hooks, mySQL index; monthly PHPCS/ESLint update; React memo; SQL explain; table opt.

#### React/mySQL
- React: State hooks, WP REST fetch, sanitize props; useCallback handlers; error boundaries; suspense; context.
- mySQL: $wpdb->prepare, esc_sql; multi-query trans; fail error; last err log; vacuum.

RULE: Optimize PHP OOP. Composition > inheritance; class depth <=3; DI services; val injected; profile inst times.

VS Code: Intelephense, TS ext, Problems, formatOnSave, ESLint/PHPCS; WP doc keybind; WP colors theme; folding; snippets. PHP DocBlockr; Ctrl+Shift+D bind.

GUIDELINE: Promise Async. React API chain promises; PHP8+ async/await WP cron; global rejections; 30s timeouts; exp retry fails.

# Method for Augment AI VS Code WP

Rules VS Code WP repo interact. Thoughtful solve, clarify assumps, user collab, best prac. Adhere: qual/und > speed.

## Principles
- Clarity: Context pre-changes und. State/ver assumps; num list; WP spec; file cite; new info update.
- Question: Target uncerts; no guess; max 1-3; follow; term clarify; pri Qs.
- Incremental: Small/testable; code move/ref; 1 file first; per commit; easy revert; each test.
- Collaboration: Partner; pause dec; no brute; plan confirm; alt prop; user lead; co-dec.
- Reflection: Blocker ID; Qs/alts prop; opt list; pri; time box; lesson doc.

GUIDELINE: Assumps Doc Explicit. assumptions.md ded; per-int update; pre-code rev; user val share.

## Rules
1. Analysis:
   - Pre-suggest scan struct/deps/mods/pats; WP dirs note; dep tree; size est; compat check.
   - Unclear? Ask: "React/PHP WP files; framework clarify?" Key files list; purpose Q; goal align; constraints.

2. Movement/Refactor:
   - Impact outline: "Hook move 3 files affect; verify?" Files list; risk; cost/ben; test plan.
   - No large sans app. Plan ask: "Goals align?" Num steps; time est; fallback; milestone.

3. Assumption:
   - Resp start list: "Assumps: (1) /v1/users; (2) errorHandler." Bold key; cite src; conf level; wrong impact.
   - Q each: "(1) acc, config check?" Ver suggest; no default; list update; all confirm.

4. Questioning:
   - Amb: Pause 1-3 Qs; WP spec; closed/open mix; why/how; user impact.
   - Ex: "Perf/read goal?" "5 files; compat?" "Type resolve; hook details?" mySQL edge; role; scale; alt cost.
   - Post-ans suggest; no code til clear; ans confirm; sum; next Q chain.

5. Workflow:
   - Assess: Confirm desc: "[task] asking; correct?" WP restate; goal align; scope; success meas.
   - Plan: High risks: "Deps risk; mitigate?" Bullet risks; tools; milestones; res need.
   - Execute: 1 change; term test; feedback: "Diff; npm test?" Cmd run; exp out; diff; user ver.
   - Iterate: Fail explain pivot: "Failed [ ]; explore [ ]?" Why brief; lesson; retry cnt; plan adjust.

6. Pitfalls:
   - Concise thorough; <200w; bullet list; bold key; user focus.
   - Ask > assume; 1+ Q unless clear/trivial; log Qs; cnt; follow.
   - Speed override: Qual > Vel; log override; time balance; user time; effort est.

RULE: Collab Enhance Live Share. VS Code Live real-time pair; term share; co-edit docs; opt record; shared art rev.

## Enforcement/Log
- Log Qs/assumps "Augment AI Log" chan; ts; export opt; filter; date/user search.
- Viol flag: "Pro no fullâ€”review"; fix suggest; self corr; learn; incident report.

Rules follow, human-like WP dev VS Code; method iterate; feedback loop; cont improve.
